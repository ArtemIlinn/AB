# üÖ∞Ô∏è/üÖ±Ô∏è Tests

An A/B test is a tool that allows us to make reliable conclusions about the impact of a change on a product, through the use of statistical methods and parallel collection of data for compared groups.


## üõ§ Sequence of steps when conducting an A/B test:
1. Select metrics and formulate hypotheses.
2. Select the randomization method and determine the sampling parameters.
3. Determine the required sample size.
4. We launch the experiment and collect data.
5. We check the validity of the experiment.

The division into groups within the A/B test should occur in parallel and randomly. This eliminates the influence of effects other than the change being tested on the metric.

When designing an experiment, it is important to consider the potential presence of network effects. If groups influence each other, then instead of simple randomization by user, more complex methods must be used.

Before conducting the test, we need to calculate the required sample size. Only after it is collected can the results be analyzed.

It is important not only to directly analyze the test results, but also to additionally check the validity of the experiment. Such checks are the A/A test and the SRM test.


## üß≠ Quantitative Metrics
All metrics are divided into quantitative, conversion and relationship metrics.
Revenue can be calculated on average per user, paying user or order.

The relationship between ARPU and ARPPU is described by the formula: 

$ARPU = ARPPU ‚ãÖ PayingShare$

where Paying share is the share of users who made a purchase.

To calculate the sample size, it is necessary to estimate the variance in the test and control groups. Since the sample size is calculated before the sample itself is recruited, these variances are estimated by averaging the variance over several past periods.

To analyze changes in quantitative metrics, we can use a T-test or a bucket test.
